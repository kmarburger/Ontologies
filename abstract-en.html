<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The room simulation ontology (RSOT) was developed to connect a simulated result to a room geometry. Therefore, it was intended to contain all of the commonly used geometric constraints and boundary conditions that can be applied to a wide range of indoor climate simulations. The RSOT ontology was developed to be expandable and to contain different types of simulation results and boundary conditions. At this state the ontology is developed to be used in the Turtle plug-in for Grasshopper (link). The ontologies was developed to ensure that the database and queries could work for a design purpose. The ontology can be further developed.

The developed ontologies are based on the principles from W3C and Tim Berners-Lee, using web ontologies described here. OWL was the main ontology used to develop the new ontologies. Besides OWL, the new ontologies built upon the Building Ontology Topology that can be found here. BOT was developed for the AEC industry as an ontology to allow the user to define a building's topology.</span>
